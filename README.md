# Data Science and Machine Learning Interview Refreshers

Here are a couple of PDFs to serve as quick refreshers or resources to revise important concepts that might be useful for interviews. Some of these concepts might be on a higher level assuming tertiary education (undergraduate degree) in the field. These serve primarily as revisors for **technical** components heavy with formulae.


## Guides

- Probability and Statistics
- Machine Learning
- Python


NOTE: The Machine Learning component can be a bit high level as it would be incredibly verbose to include formulae for all algorithms. In several sections, it only lists down concepts expecting the reader to attain familiarity with them.

## Contributions

Keeping in mind to have these PDFs serve only as refreshers, some of these might only contain high level components.

I'd be happy to address any queries or requests for additions to make these more holistic to address a wider audience.

Feel free to reach out if you would have suggestions / like to make contributions!
